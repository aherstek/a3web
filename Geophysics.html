    <Projects Overviews>
        <h2>projects Overviews</h2>
        <h3>AutoCAD Site Plan Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Objective: The AutoCAD project focused on creating a detailed site plan displaying topographic features and contours.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Geophysical Study in Phelps County, Missouri</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Objective: The study aimed to image the subsurface of a study area in Phelps County, Missouri, to a depth of 70 feet, utilizing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW).</li>
        <li>Methodology: The project involved comparing ERT profiles from different array configurations and assessing the MASW data quality. The focus was on imaging various soil types and limestone bedrock, categorizing them based on moisture content and structural integrity.</li>
        <li>Findings: The subsurface imaging successfully reached the targeted depth, with soil categorizations ranging from dry to clayey. The limestone bedrock was categorized as either weathered or intact. The study provided a consistent interpretation of the top-of-rock, aligning ERT and MASW data and correlating with the 70 ohm-m contour value.</li>
    </ul>
